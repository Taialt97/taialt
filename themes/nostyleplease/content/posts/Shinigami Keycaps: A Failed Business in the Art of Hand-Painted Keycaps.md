As a designer and artist, I was always fascinated by the combination of form and function. When I discovered the world of mechanical keyboards, I saw it as a new creative challenge and thus the creation of Shinigami Keycaps, a brand dedicated to making premium and original hand-painted keycaps.
## The Design Process
The process of creating a hand-painted keycap starts with a design drawing, which is then turned into a SolidWorks structure for compatibility and fit verification. The design is then refined through sculpting in ZBrush and mockups are created. Finally, the keycap is printed and hand-painted to bring the design to life.

## Resin Printing and Hand-Painting

The keycap design is brought to life through the process of resin printing, where UV light is used to solidify liquid resin layer by layer. The printed keycap is then post-processed to remove any supporting material and sanded for a smooth surface. To ensure a perfect fit, a test fitting is performed before painting.

I discovered my passion for miniature painting through the creation of Shinigami Keycaps. I studied techniques on YouTube to hone my skills and aim to achieve a professional and personal touch in hand-painting. I began by priming the surface and batch painted with an airbrush for consistent coverage. Fine details were added with a paintbrush, and a light coat of gloss and a matte varnish were applied for a stunning semi-matte finish.

## Final Product and Sharing

One of the most satisfying moments of creating Shinigami Keycaps is seeing the finished product, which is then photographed to showcase its unique design and intricate details. I also share mockups and posters of my designs, giving a glimpse into the thought process and how it would look on an actual mechanical keyboard.

## The Failure of Shinigami Keycaps

Making artisan keycaps is an art that requires skill and patience. Resin printing and hand-painting is a time-consuming but rewarding method. Alternatively, vacuum forming and painting with resin colors can produce more keycaps in a shorter amount of time but may not have the same personal touch. The choice of method depends on the tools, knowledge, personal preference, and desired outcome. The journey of creating artisan keycaps and sharing it with others, even though the business aspect didn't work out, is still a valuable experience.



As a designer and artist, I have always been fascinated by the intersection of form and function. So when I discovered the world of mechanical keyboards, I knew I had found my next creative challenge. And thus, Shinigami Keycaps was born â€“ a brand dedicated to creating premium and original hand-painted keycaps for mechanical keyboards.

The process of creating a hand-painted keycap begins with a drawing of the design. I then use SolidWorks to build the initial structure of the keycap and verify its fit and compatibility with other keycaps on the keyboard and the keyboard itself. The design is further refined through sculpting in ZBrush, after which mockups are created. Finally, the keycap is printed and hand-painted to bring the design to life.

The keycap design is brought to life through the process of printing in resin. Using UV light to solidify liquid resin, layer by layer, the printed keycap is then carefully post-processed. This involves removing any supporting material and sanding the surface for a smooth finish. To ensure a perfect fit, a test fitting is also performed before the keycap is ready for painting.

I found my passion for miniature painting through this keycap project, where I honed my skills by studying techniques on YouTube. My aim was to achieve a professional, almost factory-like look while still preserving the personal touch of hand-painting. I began by priming the surface to prepare it for paint. Then, I batch painted the keycaps using an airbrush to ensure consistent coverage and seamless blending. I added fine details with a paintbrush, bringing the design to its full glory. Lastly, a light coat of gloss and a light layer of matte varnish were applied to create a stunning, semi-matte finish, resulting in a one-of-a-kind keycap.

One of the most satisfying moments of creating Shinigami Keycaps is seeing the finished product. The keycaps are photographed to showcase their unique designs and intricate details. I also share mockups and posters of my designs, this gives a glimpse into the thought process and evolution of each design and how it would look on an actual mechanical keyboard.

Making artisan keycaps is an art that requires a certain level of skill and patience. One method for creating artisan keycaps is by resin printing and hand-painting, but this can be time-consuming. Hand-painting each individual keycap is a challenging task that takes time to perfect and the paint will eventually wear off. An alternative method is vacuum forming and painting with resin colors, which can produce more keycaps in a shorter amount of time and potentially result in a higher-quality, long-lasting finish. Ultimately, the choice of method depends on the tools and knowledge available, personal preference, and the desired outcome.

Even though the business aspect didn't work out, the process of creating hand-painted keycaps is still a source of creativity and personal fulfillment for me. The challenge of perfecting my techniques and designs, and sharing that with others, is a rewarding experience. While the end goal of making a successful business may not have been achieved, the journey of creating artisan keycaps and sharing it with others is still a valuable experience.
